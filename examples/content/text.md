Fish are aquatic, craniate, **gill-bearing animals** that lack limbs with digits. Included in this definition are the _living hagfish_, _lampreys_, and _cartilaginous_ and _bony fish_ as well as various extinct related groups. Approximately 95% of living fish species are __ray-finned fish__, belonging to the class _Actinopterygii_, with around 99% of those being _teleosts_. 

Fish, as vertebrata, developed as sister of the tunicata. As the tetrapods emerged deep within the fishes group, as sister of the **_lungfish_**, characteristics of fish are typically shared by `tetrapods`, including having vertebrae and a cranium.
